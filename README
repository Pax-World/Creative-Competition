# pax.world Creatives Competition
pax.world is hosting our Creatives Competition open to 3D artists of all skill levels. Your goal, should you choose to accept, is to utilize a scene from our world and use your imagination to create something out of this world. Inspiration from music, cinema, literature, nature, fashion, gaming, and education are all welcome. A winner will be chosen at the end of the competition period with the first-place winner receiving a plot of land within our metaverse world. All that is required to participate is access to the free software blender or Unity.

## what and where to download everything ##

Download the project file from GitHub here.

Our template file was done in blender version 3.0. But you probably won't have issues with using a different one later than 2.80. You can download blender here: 
	https://www.blender.org/download/
  
For Unity, download version 2019.4.13f1. You can get it here:
	https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive

## guidelines ##

- Make sure that objects are not higher than 40m or 130ft within your scene
- Your scene is limited to 10,000 polys, excluding objects provided within the template scene
- Texture sizes should be no more than 1024 X 1024 pixels
- Creators are free to create animations within their scenes (like our streetlights from the template). For this you'll want to use FBX files
- Feel free to remove any of our objects from the template but please keep the background as is 
- Only utilize cameras provided within the scene downloaded from GitHub
- Use your artistic integrity in creating your scene with your own content. Do not use copyrighted content or content you do not own yourself. Royalty-free assets are allowed
