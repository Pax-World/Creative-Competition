# Creative-Competition
Pax.world is hosting our Creatorâ€™s Competition open to 3D artists of all skill levels.  Your goal, should you choose to accept, is to utilize a scene from our world and use your imagination to create something out of this world.  Inspiration from music, cinema, literature, nature, fashion, gaming, and education are all welcome.  A winner will be chosen at the end of the two-week competition period with the first-place winner receiving a highly limited availability plot of land within our metaverse world.  All that is required to participate is access to the free software's Blender and Unity.
