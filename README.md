## What and Where to Download Everything ##

Download the project file from GitHub here.

Our template file was done in Blender version 3.0. But you probably won't have issues with using a different one later than 2.80. You can download Blender here: 
	https://www.blender.org/download/
  
For Unity, download version 2019.4.13f1. You can get it here:
	https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive

## Guidelines ##

- Make sure that objects are not higher than 40m or 130ft within your scene
- Your scene is limited to 10,000 polys, excluding objects provided within the template scene
- Texture sizes should be no more than 1024 X 1024 pixels
- Creators are free to create animations within their scenes (like our streetlights in from the template). For this you'll want to use FBX files the most
- Feel free to remove any of our objects from the template you don't want them in your scene but please keep the background as is 
- Only utilize cameras provided within the scene downloaded from GitHub, if your scene can't fit in the 
- Use your own artistic integrity in creating your scene with your own content. Do not use copyrighted content or content you do not own yourself. Royalty-free assets are allowed. 
- Be as creative as you’d like with all competitions. 
- The submission window will close two weeks after the announcement date at 12am CET
